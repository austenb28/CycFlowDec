# CycFlowDec
Simple Cycle Flow Decomposition Python Module (Version 1.0)

# Description
Takes a flow matrix representing a closed flow network and determines the simple cycle flow decomposition consistent with Min-Ping Qian's decycling algorithm [1],[2]. This is accomplished by percolating the network from a starting node, and then logging the simple cycles encountered. More information can be found in reference [3].

# Requirements
* Python3
* NumPy library
* MatPlotLib library (examples only)

# Installation
Download CycFlowDec.py and place it in your `$PYTHONPATH`.  On a Unix system, this can be accomplished by the following:

`mkdir ~/python_modules`

Place `CycFlowDec.py` in `~/python_modules`. Update your `~/.bashrc` to include 

`export PYTHONPATH="~/python_modules":$PYTHONPATH`.

# Usage
Include `from CycFlowDec import CycFlowDec` in your Python script. See the definitions section and examples for specific usage hints.

# Definitions
## `CycFlowDec(F,state,tol)`
Constructor of the CycFlowDec class.

`F`: NumPy (*N* x *N*) array. Flow matrix of the network to decycle, where *N* is the number of network nodes.  The entry *F[m,n]* corresponds to the flow from node *n* to node *m*.

`state`: Integer. The starting node for percolation.

`tol`: Float. The minimum contribution tolerance to extend percolation in the network. Should be on the range \[0,1\]. For small networks (*N* < ~10) `tol=0` should be fine.  For larger networks, `tol` can be increased to accelerate percolation at the cost of maximum achievable accuracy.

## `CycFlowDec.run(burnin,nstep)`
Runs percolating cyclic flow decomposition on `F`. Stores cycles as keys in the dictionary `CycFlowDec.cycles`, whose items correspond to the unscaled cycle weights. Cycles are defined as tuples, where the first node is the lowest index node in the cycle.

`burnin`: Integer. Number of steps to equilibrate percolation.

`nstep`: Integer. Number of steps to log cycles. Small, even numbers are often optimal, such as 2 or 4.

## `CycFlowDec.scale_cycles()`
Scales cycle weights to flow values in `CycFlowDec.cycles` using the total network flow.

## `CycFlowDec.calc_MRE(tol)`
Returns the mean relative error (MRE) of the decycled network flows with respect to the original network flows. Scales cycles weights to flow values with `CycFlowDec.scale_cycles()` if it hadn't been called previously.

`tol`: Float. Minimum flow tolerance for edges to contribute to the MRE calculation.

# Examples
See `Examples` folder. Examples require `matplotlib`. Execute with `python <example.py>`.  Three node and seven node examples should complete instantly; the 64 node example requires around 5 minutes. The 64 node example is a Markov state model network instance of a Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter [4].
